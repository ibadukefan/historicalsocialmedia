# CONTENT GUIDE: Making Posts Feel AUTHENTIC

## The Problem

Current posts are too:
- **Event-focused** - everything references a historical moment
- **Meaningful** - every post has a "point"
- **Complete** - too polished and thought-out
- **Serious** - missing humor, irony, randomness
- **One-dimensional** - always about "important stuff"

Real social media is 90% mundane garbage and 10% meaningful content. We have that ratio inverted.

## Historical Adaptations

The key is making these UNIVERSAL HUMAN experiences fit the 1776 context:

### Weather
- Modern: "AC is broken. This is how I die."
- 1776: "No breeze. The flies are winning. This is how I die."

### Work
- Modern: "My boss just cc'd me on an email I sent. Peak management."
- 1776: "The overseer just explained my own job to me. As if I haven't done it for twenty years."

### Technology frustration
- Modern: "WiFi is down again"
- 1776: "Wheel broke again. That's the third one this year. Who's making these?"

### Social media itself
- Modern: "Why am I on this app at 2am"
- 1776: "Why am I at this tavern again. Same people saying the same things."

## Examples of GOOD vs BAD Posts

### BAD (Too historical/explanatory):
> "The Continental Congress has voted for independence. This historic moment marks the beginning of a new nation. I witnessed history today."

### GOOD (Human reaction):
> "It's done. They actually did it. I need a drink. Several drinks."

---

### BAD (Too event-focused):
> "The British army has been defeated at Trenton. Washington's bold crossing of the Delaware has turned the tide of war."

### GOOD (Human reaction):
> "THEY DID IT. We actually won something?? I'm crying in the street and I don't care who sees."

---

### BAD (Too serious):
> "The mita labor system continues to claim lives in the silver mines."

### GOOD (Personal/emotional):
> "Twelve more. Gone. My cousin among them. His wife won't stop crying."

---

### BAD (Over-explaining):
> "As a tea merchant in Canton, I observe the British traders with their silver..."

### GOOD (In the moment):
> "Another ship. More men pointing at things. Silver silver silver. At least they pay."

## The "Nothing Post" Rule

**At least 30% of posts should be about NOTHING in particular.**

These posts have no historical significance. They don't connect to any event. They're just... life.

Examples:
- "Dog won't stop barking at nothing. There's NOTHING THERE."
- "Ate an entire loaf. No regrets. Some regrets."
- "Why do I always wake up before dawn even when I don't need to."
- "Watching the clouds. There's a face in one. He looks angry."
- "My feet hurt."
- "The cat brought me something dead. Thanks I guess."
- "Can't find my good [item]. The one I always use. Gone."
- "Neighbors are too quiet today. What's happening over there."

---

## Content Mix Guidelines

For every 10 posts in the feed:
- 3 should be NOTHING posts (mundane, no historical significance)
- 2 should be complaints/venting
- 2 should be family/relationship observations
- 1 should be a question or engagement post
- 1 should be a small celebration or observation
- 1 should be tied to actual historical events

This ratio makes the feed feel like LIFE, with historical events happening IN the midst of life, rather than history with occasional life.

## Final Checklist Before Writing Posts

Ask yourself:
1. Would I scroll past this on modern social media?
2. Does this sound like a PERSON or a history book?
3. Is there room for a "nothing post" nearby?
4. Have I included complaints? Random thoughts? Questions?
5. Does every post NEED historical context, or is it just... life?

**If every post feels significant, none of them do.**
